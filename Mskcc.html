                            <br> Starting the Summer of my freshman year in high school, up until the end of the my senior year
                            in high school, I worked in a research lab at MSKCC. I worked in Dr. Dan Heller's lab, under Dr. Ryan
                            Williams, studying carbon nanotubes and their usage as
                            <i>in vivo</i> sensors for cancer detection. During the summer I spent anywhere from 45-50 hours
                            a week in the lab and 20-25 hours during the school year. During this time I learned a lot of
                            laboratory skills that I may not ever use again, but also how to commmunicate my results efficiently
                            and an understandable manner. I spent a lot of time processing data using MATLAB and then creating
                            visual figures to showcase results. I was a Siemens semifinalist, and was picked to be a part
                            of the 15 project team representing NYC out of hundreds of submitted projects at the International
                            Science and Engineering Fair.
                            <br> Currently I am the second author of two papers from the laboratory. One is published in
                            <i>Science Advances</i> and details a project about HE4 sensing for Ovarian Cancer. Another is has been 
                            accepted for publishing in
                            <i>ACS Sensors</i> about detecting uPA for prostate cancer detection.

                                <i>This was my research focus, carbon nanotubes! One thing that's really awesome about them
                                    (there are actually a ton of uses for them) is that when DNA is wrapped around them,
                                    they become fluorescent in the Near-Infrared. That's a wavelength that we can't see,
                                    but can shine through biological material. This could potentially allow us to plant sensors
                                    inside the body, for use as "wearable sensors".
