                            <b>Position:</b> Full Stack Engineering Intern
                            <br>
                            <b>Time:</b> July 2018-August 2018
                            <br>
                            <b>Location:</b> Cape Town, South Africa
                            <br>
                            <br> During the summer of my sophomore year I interned at a Blockchain and Cryptocurrency startup.
                            From here, I learned more about what having a daily job in a tech company was like. I joined
                            the daily standups of the software engineering team as well as occasional meetings with the founder
                            and marketing teams to discuss my projects.
                            <br>
                            <br> I handled multiple small projects as well as one big one. My main project was creating
                            a <a href="dashboard.html">dashboard</a> for updating the company's balances. I got to start the project from scratch and
                            build both the front end and back end myself. This full-stack approach really taught me how to
                            create a user friendly app, on both the front end and backend, and how to design better front
                            ends for easy integration.
                            <br>
                            <br> For other projects, I created grpc services and researched different ways to create a wrapper
                            class that converted REST API calls into grpc services (JSON -> protobuffs), and setup testing
                            for other grpc services using Locust. I learned and utilized a lot of skills for this internship.

                                    I do have a ton of photos from Cape Town! This is a photo from the top of Table Mountain.
                                    Over the summer, not only did I learn a lot about coding, I also gained a lot of experience in 
                                    travel and being abroad. I had the most amazing summer of my life, and it really inspired to explore
                                    and travel more.                                    <i>
