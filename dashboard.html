                            <b>Timeline:</b> August 2018
                            <br>
                            <b>Created For:</b> Invictus Capital
                            <br><br> This was the basic dashboard I created for Invictus Capital. I developed the front end and back
                            end of a dashboard from scratch and it allowed the Fund Manager to directly update the company's
                            holdings within a certain token(e.g. 20 BTC -> 10 BTC). I used React.js for the front end and
                            Falcon for the backend, with ReThinkDB as the database Previously, to rebalance the fund manager
                            would need to write down all the updated balances and then give them to the software engineers
                            who would change it on the backend. This happened weekly and was time consuming. The dashboard
                            also allowed the user to see addresses of their tokens, and provided Create and Update functions
                            for these addresses, allowing the user to easily edit addresses. This would be extremely useful
                            for tokens such as IOTA, which have a non-consistent way of updating their tokens.
                            <br><br> Again, these were still relatively new frameworks for me to use, so I learned a lot just from
                            doing this project. To develop the overall look I used Figma, and then worked with the marketing
                            team to follow their standards. I was particularly excited to be using React.js, as it is very
                            popular now for app development.

                                    Here I showcase different features of the dashboard such as user login-ins, editing balances
                                    of different tokens (which maintains edited on the backend as shown by refreshing the
                                    page) and adding in addresses for specific tokens.
