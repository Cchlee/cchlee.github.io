                            <br>
                            <br> For our Hack, I worked with a partner to create a bullet journal companion app. Neither of us
                            had experience in app development so we literally looked up "app development mac", and were guided
                            to using Xcode for Swift. We were able to create a welcome page, take user input, create a quote
                            generator, and a layout suggestions page. This was a really fun project to create, and I was
                            really impressed with how much we were able to get done in a just a few hours (we left HackMIT
                            early), in a language we didn't know.
