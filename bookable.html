                            <b>Created For:</b> iXperience Program
                            <br>
                            <br> For my Full Stack Coding class as a part of the iXperience program, over the course of a month
                            I worked with a partner to develop an booking app. The idea for the app was to create an app,
                            that allowed users to directly choose where they wanted to be when making their reservation.
                            For example, in restaurants, movie theaters, or any form of transportation, they could choose
                            their specific seat. Through the class and working on the project, we learned about the steps
                            behind app and web development. We followed an agile workflow, had daily standups, and used Trello
                            to communicate our progress.
                            <br><br> On the front end side, we started by creating wireframes for our pages. We then started developing
                            frontend using Ionic, a mobile app kit, which is built on top of Angular.js.
                            <br><br> On the back end side, we created a UML diagram to map out what we wanted users to be able to
                            have access to. We created the backend REST API through loopback, a Node.js framework. We stored
                            all endpoint data in mySQL. We also added three third-party integrations, Yelp, Google Maps,
                            and Stripe.
                            <br> Some of our features included:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Making a Booking(pretty hard as MySQL can't store 2d Arrays)</li>
                                <li>Creating a User</li>
                                <li>Token Authentication </li>
                                <li>Password Encryption</li>
                                <li>Payments through Stripe</li>
                                <li>Searching a location through Google Maps</li>
                                <li>Getting Venue Information of a Star through Yelp</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br> Before working on this project, I knew very little about app development, I didn't even know
                            what RESTful architecture was. I also had never learned any of the frameworks used before so
                            it was really exciting to be creating something with no prior experience in the langauges.
